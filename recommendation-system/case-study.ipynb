    "# Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Recommendation Systems?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems date back to the early 90's where they were first developed by researchers to suggest important documents to the readers based on the review ratings provided by other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It became mainstream after tech giants like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and others integrated it with their systems to recommend relevant content and products to the users. Especially as personalized recommendations gained traction so did recommendation system algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems are behind suggesting movies, ads, youtube videos, music to the users based on their interests or we can say based on their predicted interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Easier said than done, it's not easy for a computer to figure out what hooks a user to a particular video or movie - is it the lead actor, story line, timepass, curiosity etc etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using maths as a tool, researchers have been able to predict user's interest based on explicit reviews or by collecting information from similar users or using metadata like watch time, clicks etc (implicit review).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we analyze two of the most popular approaches used in recommendation systems.\n",
    " 1. Content-Based Filtering\n",
    " 2. Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before we get into the specifics of these approaches,let's analyze all the known options available to implement these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Types of Recommendation Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "For large size applications like youtube, netflix etc. the recommendation system cannot rely on one approach. As one might have noticed on the Netflix home page, there are different categories of suggestions - one based on view history, other based on popularity, another one based on similar interests etc. On the other hand on youtube we generally get more recommendations based on our view history. Both these systems use a hybrid method of recommendation systems plus neural networks to add additional context while predicting a new favorite.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a far more simpler use case like a small business that sells a few products to a limited number of users, a simple collaborative filtering approach might work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other technology in use today, depending on the specific use case, engineers will have to pick a suitable method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few different approaches that are available today are:\n",
    "1. Content-Based Filtering: Recommend products that are similar to the one user liked/watched/purchased.\n",
    "2. Collaborative Filtering: Recommend products that users with similar interest are watching / buying.\n",
    "3. Hybrid Methods: Using both the approaches mentioned in #1 and #2.\n",
    "4. Deep Learning-Based Methods: Neural Collaborative Filtering: Uses neural networks to model user-item interactions more complexly and accurately. eg.Autoencoders\n",
    "(This was first tried by Amazon and won them an award https://www.amazon.science/the-history-of-amazons-recommendation-algorithm)\n",
    "5. Context-Aware Recommendations: Incorporates additional context (e.g., time, location, device) to enhance recommendations. For example, suggesting different types of restaurants based on the time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these approaches there are also a few lesser known/discussed techniques like,\n",
    "1. Rule-Based Filtering:  Uses domain-specific rules and knowledge to make recommendations. For example, a travel recommendation system might suggest destinations based on the user's preferences and constraints.**This can also be integrated as an additional step on top of the filtering methods discussed earlier**\n",
    "2. Association Rule Mining / Apriori Algorithm:Identifies frequent item sets and generates association rules to suggest items that are often bought together."

    "\n",
    "Most basic and yet effective form of a recommendation system can be built using content based filtering. Base concept here is - suggest items that are similar to the items user has previously engaged with. For example - If someone buys \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho, also suggest other books that falls under the same genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a content based filtering system involves two main steps - one is to analyze and make sense of the data and second is to find data that are similar to each other.\n",

The system will have to suggest something different or surprise the user with something out of the routine every now and then. For these purposes, we need a technique other than content based recommendations. \n",

    "In recommendation systems, matrix factorization can be used to predict missing entries in a user-item interaction matrix by decomposing it into a user-feature matrix and an item-feature matrix. This approach is purely algebraic and does not involve neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of movie recommendation system, the data we initially work on to implement a collabotive filtering technique would be a review matrix. That is, user ids, movie ids and the ratings user gave to the movies. \n",
